This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description 

BiObserve is a web-based application which allows users to log spotted locations of flora and fauna seen in nature. With an individual account and unique login, users are able to view a public map displaying all users sightings through dynamic pins. By scrolling around the map, users can view these pins which provide the flora or fauna spotted, who logged it, and when. Additionally, users can view and search all logged animals if they are trying to find sightings of a particular organism or user. Through their individual account, they can also view all posts they have made to the app, edit any posts they had made previously, or add new posts to the map. Together, BiObserve aims to provide a means in which nature lovers and animal spotters can share information of sightings in one seamless and coordinated place.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
